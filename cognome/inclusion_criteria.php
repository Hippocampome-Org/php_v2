<center><u>Level of Implementation</u></center>
<br><u>Fully implemented:</u> the research reports having constructed and successfully run a simulation with the model
<br><u>Partially implemented:</u> some approaches, techniques, or formulas are described that can be used in a future model. A model has not been reported to have been run in a simulation.
<br><u>Not implemented:</u> No specific approaches, techniques, or formulas are described for use in a model. A model has not been reported to have been run in a simulation. A general type or category of model has been included in the articleâ€™s writing.
<br>
<br><u>All methods available:</u> all information needed to recreate the model is available directly through descriptions included in the article.
<br><u>Some methods available:</u> some methods are included in the articles writing but key elements are missing that are needed for reproduction. Those elements are one of the following: formulas used to represent neurons, biophysical parameters to represent the region under study, formulas used to generate network-level activity of neurons.
<br><u>Not implemented:</u> a significant lack of methods are explicitly described in the literature which would be used to recreate the model described.
