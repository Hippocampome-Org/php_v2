Requirement: one entity of this dimension is needed to be annotated for an article to be accepted into the core collection. The simulation must be a scale of at least 10 neurons. The neurons must be spiking. Of these minimum number of neurons, each spike time must be recorded and not only an average reported of multiple spikes. The neurons must have at least some connections, and must be more than no connections. 
<br><br>
Only neurons that are fully modeled, e.g., no signal generators, etc., are counted in the scale of the network. Neurons that are outside of the hippocampus region but in the hippocampus-included simulation are counted. Any neurons in a simulation where the simulation does not include the hippocampus are excluded from the count. The total neurons in individual simulations are counted, not the sum count of neuron across multiple simulations. For example, two simulations with 400 neurons each would be annotated as a scale of 400 neurons total, not 800 neurons. A minimum acceptable number of neurons needs to be explicitly described in the article. Network scales are not assumed or guessed.
<br><br>
The circuit/network simulated must be based in biology. An artificial neural network does not count toward the presence of a circuit/network simulation. An original simulation must be performed, not only described as methods. In other words, not only do computational methods need to be described, but a simulation must have been performed with them.
<br><br>
It is permissible to reuse a previously developed simulation design, as long as the authors created a new  simulation using that design. More specifically, only referencing results from another articleâ€™s simulation is insufficient to qualify an article for acceptance into this annotation collection. In the work described with the article being annotated the authors must have created a new run of a simulation that meets annotation requirements listed here for the article to be acceptable for inclusion in this collection.
<br><br>
Q: Is there a minimum spiking amount needed for each neuron?
<br>
A: A requirement is that the simulation in general needs to produce some spiking. However, if a neuron has a neuron model is capable of spiking, but it didn't spike in a simulation, it still counts as a neuron with an acceptable neuron model. For example, if a certain neuron only receives inhibitory input for the purposes of the simulation, and that causes no spiking, as long as other neurons in the simulation perform spiking, that neuron that didn't spike still counts as an acceptable neuron because its neuron model would model spiking if relevant input was provided by that.

<u>When to annotate neuron types</u>
<br>Only neuron types that were specifically named as being modeled are annotated. At this time, general forms of neurons, e.g., grid cells, are too unspecific to annotate a particular neuron type for them unless a specific type is described such as stellate cell, etc. In the future there potentially will be an automated process where such general types are automatically assigned to specific neuron types, and that process will be able to be updated when new knowledge is gained about them over time.
<br><br>
<u>Which neurons are included</u>
<br>Neurons must be fully modeled to be included in neuron type annotations. A fully modeled neuron has an equation that receives input, translates that input through a function (e.g., action potential detection), and creates output. A simple form of this is a binary neuron that passes input through a function that calculates if it reaches a spike threshold then outputs a value of 1 if it does. An example of a non-fully modeled neuron is a signal generator that generates values based on probability but does not process input through a function that determines its output. Such a non-fully modeled neuron is considered not sufficiently complete to be acceptable for annotation as a neuron type representation. A distinction is also that if a neuron model's equations are capable of receiving synapses or other connections, even if it does not receive input in the simulation, it is still counted as fully-modeled. An exception to the requirement to directly state a neuron type is if an article references a pathway or process with known neuron types, e.g., Schaffer collaterals, and includes fully modeled neurons to represent the the pathway, the annotation of relevant neuron types is made because of neuron types known to exist in the pathway. In contrast, for another example, a signal generator that provides general CA3 input is not annotated as a neuron type because there is a lack of specificity about what neuron type was included and non-fully modeled neurons were used.
<br><br>
<u>When to use references</u>
<br>It is acceptable to count a neuron type as included if properties of that neuron type are included, even if a specific description of the neuron type is not present. For example, the article can state that the modeling parameters for a neuron were based on the results of an experiment and that experiment was found to record CA1 Ivy cells. In this case CA1 Ivy cells are annotated even if the modeling article did not specifically describe that its neuron model was of CA1 Ivy cells and only included a reference
for that information. The exception to this rule is if the article describes the intention to represent a general group of neurons, e.g., principle cells or interneurons, and the neuron type properties were arbitrarily chosen to represent that group, even though they were based on specific neuron types. In that case the intention is for a general and not specific neuron type. For example, the model is for CA1 interneurons, and properties of CA1 basket cells were used, but the article specifically described 
that the neurons are to be interpreted as CA1 interneurons in general, and therefore the simulated neurons are interpreted as a general form and not a specific type. In general, whatever the article describes as its intention to simulate is what is annotated as being simulated. 
<br><br>
<u>Resolving reference vs. annotated article annotation choices</u>
<br>If the article only describes that 'interneurons' were in the model and indicates that CA1 was simulated, then even if the properties of the neurons simulated were from specific neuron types in the references, an interpretation of only general neurons and not specific types will be made because that was what was described in the annotated article. The annotated article's descriptions, including lack of further descriptions, supersedes the descriptions in the references in the event of a confusion about what annotation choice should be made. It is reemphasized here that the interpretation of the intent of the annotated article in its entity descriptions should be the basis of annotation choices as compared to referenced articles.
<br><br>
<u>Lack of subregions specification</u>
<br>Neuron type annotations are only made when hippocampal subregions are specified in the simulation, because otherwise the annotation would be too general.
